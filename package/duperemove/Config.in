	  Duperemove is a simple tool for finding duplicated extents
	  and submitting them for deduplication. When given a list
	  of files it will hash their contents on a block by block
	  basis and compare those hashes to each other, finding and
	  categorizing blocks that match each other. When given the
	  -d option, duperemove will submit those extents for
	  deduplication using the Linux kernel extent-same ioctl.
